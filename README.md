# PTU Mixed Resources

Macros, Items, and alike.

There are Macros for Players and GMs. The GM macros could be run by players and give out info they should not get. E.g. listing a folder like "PKM When friendly NPC turns evil". This is why there are two different packs for GM and non-GM macros.

If you just want to browse Macros and not install the Add-On Module, check out the files in `src/[some-pack]/[macro_name].js` - like `src/gm-macros/cap-rate-base100.js` or `src/player-macros/daily-exp.js`. You can easily ignore the `.json` files
