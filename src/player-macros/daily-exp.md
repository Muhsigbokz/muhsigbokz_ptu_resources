This macro takes care of your Daily Exp Training. 

All Pokémon owned by you Player Character are listed. It shows both their current
Exp, the Exp after Training and possible Level Ups. After selecting which Pokémon to train
there is a confirmation screen. Then, a GM whisper is sent with what you have trained
to help you bookkeeping and the Exp are added.

*Regarding the ways of Exp Training.* I covered four cases:

1. Beast Master with Intimidate
2. Groomer with highest of General Education and Pokémon Education
3. Command Training with Train the Reserves
4. Command Training without Train the Reserves

I check for the appropriate features by both title and description, but allow for some modifications.
E.g. `[Level 13] Beast Master intim Training` and `Beast Master` would be found, but `beast master` not.
If all of this behaviour does not fit you, you can check out the Macro and look
for a section marked with `// Custom Exp`.

Uncomment the section below and adjust the Math to your liking. I expect
many table sto rule and home brew the ever living Distortion World out of this topic.
