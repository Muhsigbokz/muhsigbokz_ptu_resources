Macro **needs to be personalized for each Sage using it.**
Macro **must be run by GM or each player that is buffed, not only the Sage.**

*Toggles* a Sage Shield buff (Damage Reduction based on Sages Occult Ed and targets max HP) for all
selected tokens. Properly calculates Damage Reduction and gives the higher of Occult Ed or tenth of Max HP.
Also toggles light effect for sage shielded tokens. Interaction with light 
can be easily commented out. the parts are marked.

When you want to use this, import the Macro and edit it. **Either** set the Player Name (not char name) on top to 
the Sage Player (not Char) **or** set the Sage Characters Actor ID in the macro.

TODO make lighting a boolean not via commenting code
