A combo macro to run after training Pokémon.
When run, **ALL OTHER ORDERS AND TRAININGS ARE UNSET!** 

Opens a window showing all Pokémon your Player Character owns. Also,
you get a checkbox for each [Agility, ...] Training you have to quickly
select which Pokémon to train.

Can also be easily used to reset all trainings and orders by running it
without selecting anything in the popup window and just confirming.
