Little helper to check if you forgot something between combats, sessions or rests.

For all Pok√©mon your marked Player Character owns, check and show:


1. Injuries - whether and how many
2. Level-Up Points - whether not zero any how many
3. Missing HP - if any missing how much (or over max HP...)
4. Combat Stages - whether any is not zero
5. Food Buffs - whether and which one
6. Held Items - where and which one
7. Trained - whether any training

Also, on top of the Macro is a little spot for personal notes.
I like to keep track of where I attacked my Rune Master Glyphs there <3
