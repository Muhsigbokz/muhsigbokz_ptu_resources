This macro calculates a Pokémons capture rate for a d100 roll. It sends the calculation
and result to chat as a whisper to GM. It takes into account:

1. The Evolution Line of the Pokémon Species (care for custom Pokémon)
2. The Pokémons Level
3. HP
4. Injuries
5. Effects

Care about the Effects. Any effect that does not look like a Round/Turn Move info or a Training/Order 
is assumed to be a 'bad status' that improves the catch rate. Always double-check the calc does not
take something into account it should not.
