Wanna run MissingNo., but you are afraid of Metronome? Fear no more!

This Macro sends a Message to chat that lists three random moves. These moves can be dragged 
from chat into a char sheet to then be run from an actor to properly include all their stats.
I have no idea how to do this with less pain, so take it for what it is. 

It also offers functionality to add custom Moves that are in a designated Compedium Pack.

Assume you have a Compendium called "Glitch Moves" with custom moves like "Glitch Tackle". And you would like to have 
a lot of these moves pulled compared to the about normal 810 moves Metronome can legally draw.

In the macro is an out commented block starting with `const moveSourcesArray`. There are two objects, one of which 
has paths like `world.glitchmoves`. Check this out or ask here for help. this need more input...

TODO finish this explanation properly.
