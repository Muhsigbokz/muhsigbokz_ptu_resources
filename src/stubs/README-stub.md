# PTU Mixed Resources

Macros, Items, and alike.

## You want just some macros but not all the hassle

Check the lower parts of this README for the Macros in here and pick the ones you like. Copy paste the
content of the Javascript files into a Macro and mark it as `script`.

## You want the whole goodness and mediocre community content

Open the admin console of your Foundry VTT instance and download the whole Add-On module via the
link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muhsigbokz/muhsigbokz_ptu_resources/master/module.json`.

## You want to learn something about writing macros

Great! I also want this to be a resource for best practices and common hacks on how to 
bend the game to your will. Please ask around, even as an issue in the issue tracker if you want.
